# UK-Sponsorship-Checker
This project helps international job seekers in the UK verify if a company sponsors work visas. It utilizes a CSV file containing UK companies that might sponsor visas, allowing users to search for specific companies or scan keywords on job descriptions for indicators of sponsorship eligibility.

## Features
CSV-Based Sponsorship Search: Check if a company appears on a list of sponsoring companies with options for exact and partial name matching.
Job Description Keyword Search: Scan a job posting URL for keywords such as "visa sponsorship," "right to work," and "work permit" to find relevant mentions.
Interactive Menu: Users can search the company list or check job descriptions directly from an interactive prompt.
